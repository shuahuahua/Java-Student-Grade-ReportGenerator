## Introduction

This project demonstrates expertise in working with real-world datasets and highlights the practical use of machine learning methods for classification problems. The implementation is thoroughly documented, and the results are analyzed in detail, offering valuable insights into the model's effectiveness and its broader applications.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a CSV file (bini_grades.csv) containing student names and their respective grades. This data is parsed and processed to compute final grades, evaluate student performance, and generate detailed reports.

## Tools and Libraries

- Java (JDK) – Core programming language  
- IntelliJ IDEA – IDE used for project development
- Standard Java I/O libraries – For reading CSV files and writing text reports

## Installation

To set up and execute this analysis on your local system, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/JavaCaseStudy.git


2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-compatible IDE.

3. Ensure Java SDK is configured properly in your environment.

## Usage

1. Place the bini_grades.csv file inside the root project folder.

2. Run the main class to execute the report generation.

3. Check the Generated Report Cards folder for the output .txt files.

## Results

The project generates a text-based report card for each student, including their name, subject-wise grades, and remarks. These reports are timestamped for reference and organized within the Generated Report Cards directory.
