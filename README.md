## Introduction

This project demonstrates expertise in working with real-world datasets and highlights the practical use of machine learning methods for classification problems. The implementation is thoroughly documented, and the results are analyzed in detail, offering valuable insights into the model's effectiveness and its broader applications.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset, a well-known standard in data science, includes samples from three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By utilizing advanced machine learning libraries and techniques, this project develops a classification model that learns intricate patterns within the dataset to make accurate predictions on new data.

## Tools and Libraries
